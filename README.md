# graphene-test

This is a test to verify your python skill using graphene module. Here it is. I hope you like the movie Starwars.

Please fork this into your account.

Using python 3.5+ graphene module, please extend starwars_relay example schema to include new entity called: Charts
For simplicity Chart will only have "name" we want 3 entires [chart-a,chart-b,chart-c] added to the data. 

* Under query we need to be able to resolve charts. 
* Under Character we want a LIST of availabe charts for a character. Character can have many charts or none.  
* Under Ship we want to allow only one Chart or no chart. 

We need to be able to query for Chart and see one or more chart
We need to be able to query for Ship and see at least one referened chart
We need to be able to query for Character and see at leaast referenced chart

When you're done, let me know through communicator the github username of your fork and I will verify.
Good Luck!
